This floor was the domain of the linen-maid who was responsible for the household linen and possibly the clothes of the owners. 

In one of the four rooms a fireplace had a place for heating up irons. Large cupboards occupied a good part of the space here, but this was nothing compared to the rooms on the lower level which were full of them. 

The notebook which the linen-maid kept until 1910 records no less than a hundred sheets and more than three hundred tablecloths of all types: large or small for the breakfast trays or the top of the sideboards, damask, white or decorated with garlands of rosesâ€¦
