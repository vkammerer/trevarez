# Servant's bedroom

Some of the servants had bedrooms on the third floor. The ch√¢teau had twenty-odd rooms equipped with one or two beds, a fireplace, a radiator, a small wash-room and electricity. On this floor there were at least three toilets.

In the corridor there was probably a bell board, to ensure that the owner and his guests could call for service even at night.
