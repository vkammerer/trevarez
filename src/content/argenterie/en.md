# The silverware room

This room was the preserve of the maitre d'or the butler who was responsible for the silverware.

Protected by a reinforced door, the room was furnished with cupboards lined with red fabric, specially designed for holding valuable dishes and cutlery.

Tucked into a mezzanine level, the silverware room was connected to the kitchen area and the dining-room by means of a serving-hatch. This enabled the dishes and cutlery to pass from place to place efficiently without the servants having to use the service-stairs, and a further benefit was that it reduced the risk of breakages and theft.
