# Servant's bathroom

Use of a bath-tub was still a new idea in early 20th century society, and yet at Tr√©varez the servants could have a bath in one of two bathrooms reserved for their use. These also had heated towel-rails, like those of the owner and guests.

In 1907 it was very unusual for servants to have the use of a bathroom or toilet. Very often in town-houses they were lodged in tiny rooms under the eaves and had to share a single poorly maintained toilet.
