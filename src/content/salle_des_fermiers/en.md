# Produce room or gardener's storeroom

Some of the produce from the estate farms and kitchen garden were placed in this room before being redistributed into the various pantries for game, fish, vegetables…

At the centre of the room, a cabin of wood and cork, forerunner of our freezers, had pride of place. Thanks to this machine, which compressed gas to create low temperatures, the château always had a store of blocks of ice available for use in the cool cupboards.

This was also the entry point for electricity produced in the electric station in the stable-block.
