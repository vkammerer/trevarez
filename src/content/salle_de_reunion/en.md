# Servants' meeting room

As far as we know, the servants used this room to get together and receive their instructions for the day or the week.

It was also probably their leisure area where they played cards, read the papers, talked and wrote to their families, and on some evenings organized a fest noz or musical entertainment.

It's rare to find this type of room in other great houses. Most of the time everything took place in the dining-room which we usually call the servants' hall.

There was a telephone nearby in a small room with wooden and fabric covered walls. Its original purpose was most likely for communicating with the stables.
